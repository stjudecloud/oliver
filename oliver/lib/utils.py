    In particular, passing in a mapping parses all of the values with _query_var:

    and _query_var expects the value to be either a str or an int:

    The solution is to transform the dictionary to a list of tuples where
    the tuples are formed as (key, value). You can have multiple entries for
    (key, _) denoting an array.

    Args:
        d (Dict): a dictionary to be passed into aiohttp.

    Returns:
        List[Tuple]: the dictionary as a list of tuples as described above.
